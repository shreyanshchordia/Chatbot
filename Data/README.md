# Raw Data

The data on which the entire Chat Bot is built is the ChatterbotEnglish Dataset from Kaggle. 
I have uploaded the zip folder of the data here as `chatterbotenglish.zip` folder. 
To start from completely raw data you can download, unzip and use the folder.

# Structured Data

In the Notebook `DataPreperation.ipynb` I have prepared a structured version of the raw data and stored it in `data.pkl`. It has tokenized data and augmented data (generated by using `<unk>` tags and similar word replacement). If you do not wish to waste time in structuring the data you can download `data.pkl`.

The file `data.pkl` has the output generated from DataPreparation.ipynb.
