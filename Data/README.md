# Raw Data

The data on which the entire Chat Bot is built is the ChatterbotEnglish Dataset from Kaggle. 
I have uploaded the zip folder of the data here as `chatterbotenglish.zip` folder. 
To start from completely raw data you can download, unzip and use the folder.

# Structured Data

In the Notebook `DataPreperation.ipynb` I have prepared a structured version of the raw data and stored it in `data.pkl`. It has tokenized data and augmented data (generated by using `<unk>` tags and similar word replacement). If you do not wish to waste time in structuring the data you can download `data.pkl`.

The file `data.pkl` has the output generated from DataPreparation.ipynb.

# Completely Processed Data

1. The `processed_data.pkl` file is a dictionary that has two keys:   

    a. questions
    
    b. answers

2. Each key is a list of 1329 sentences. Hence `len(processed_data['questions'])` and `len(processed_data['answers'])` is equal to 1329.

3. Each sentence begins with `<sos>` tag and ends with `<eos>` tag.

4. Each sentence has a fixed length of 30 words. Sentences that have short lengths are padded with the tag `<pad>`.

5. By generating a Vocabulary for the data and converting the sentences into number sequences, the data becomes completely feedable to a sequence model.
